Project: Outbreak Squad
Group's repository: https://github.com/Jellonator/Outbreak-Squad

What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I really like this bit of code from Enemy_Boss.gd:
    func _ready():
        shoot()
    func shoot():
        while true:
            var bullet = bullet_scn.instance()
            bullet.set_position(get_position())
            get_parent().add_child(bullet)
            yield(get_tree().create_timer(.5), "timeout")
I never thought to create a continuous loop that runs on a timer like this

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
You play as a white blood cell fending off invaders, such as the corona virus.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I really like how the bullets use a visibility notifier to know when to destroy themselves, and I think that would be a useful way to handle projectiles in future projects.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
A lot of the 'preload' calls had the capitalization wrong, which meant that the game didn't run properly on Linux.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Honestly, all of the code was well written and easy to understand.

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
The README was well written and organized, but I think a bulleted list would have been better than using ```.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
The music was sick and the art looked really good.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
4
