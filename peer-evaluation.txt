What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 How to make a boss in a space shooter game

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 Use the space shooter type of game to reflect the theme of the virus by eliminating monsters

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 The inclusion of the boss in the game is very exciting, and I think defeating the boss is also one of the very important elements in the game.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 In the game, only ammunition can damage the player. I think it would be a good choice for the traveling monster to hurt the player. Not only that, adding the game over screen to the game will make the game more complete.Also, the bullet speed of monsters can be appropriately changed in different ways, and the types of monsters can be separated. The score of each monster can be different and more diversified.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 I really like their ui, concise and clear, but there is a little cofuse about how to set the ui script

Is it clear that every group member participated?

Yes, they have a clear division of work and do a great job

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Nothing. This group not only wrote the division of work and the description of the game very clearly, but also remembered the elements that they need to add in the future, very complete

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

The game is great! The UI is clear and concise, and the background music of the game is also very immersible in the game. The game's judgment is very accurate, and it is a model worth learning!
