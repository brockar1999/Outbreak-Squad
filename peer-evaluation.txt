Project: Outbreak Squad
Group's repository:  https://github.com/brockar1999/Outbreak-Squad



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project? 
How to add in a fixed shooter rather than just shooting whenever the player presses a button.

 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme? 
The player is a white blood cell fighting off diseases that could make the person sick.

 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games? 
A boss fight, I just realized I haven't had any in any game I've created.

 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Perhaps have the boss shoot in more than just one direction or make it so that the player has to weave through his shots to shoot him where the bullets are coming from, because right now I just have to sit in one place and shoot the boss for it to die. Also, I would suggest having a difference between the end screen when the player wins vs loses.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
There was a script for 1UP, Powerups, and HealthUp, which confused me as to what the difference between them were, but other than that no, the game ran smoothly and I did not see any errors.

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Perhaps just adding a screenshot of the game play to go along with the thumbnail picture in the Assets folder.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game. 
WOW! It's kind of hard for me to believe that you got all that done in 48 hours, and the readme makes it seem like everyone worked really well together. The enemies' designs are so cute.
