Group's repository: https://github.com/brockar1999/Outbreak-Squad



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 I learned that you can use a boss as a scene. I thought that was a cool implementation.


In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 The theme is an "Osmosis Jones-esque" theme and it reflects the given theme of cornavirus.


What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 I would like to apply a boss level. I also want to implement the sound effects the way they did.


What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 I wasn't sure how to kill the boss. That was the only thing that I thought could be improved.


Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

In the enemy script, I was confused what "setget set_health" served a purpose for on line 4.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Yes, each clearly contributed in the area that was stated on the README.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 I think the description of the game itself and the objective could've gone a little more in depth. Other than that, I thought the read me was good.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

Very impressive work for the amount of time given to do the project. I liked the sound effects and enemy graphics.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
