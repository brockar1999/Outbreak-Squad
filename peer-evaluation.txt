What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
Stuff and things.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
You play as a white blood cell. Which during the time of writing there is a pandemic going on. Topical.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
Personally created art. Most of my games I struggle in the art department.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Due to the time constraint on the project they were not able to get player damage in. You can beat the game without playing.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Nope.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
The screenshot on the readme instead of in the files. Use the MD syntax ![name](filepath)
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
The art really impressed me. It looks like every sprite was custom.


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
2.5 out of my total points of 5.
