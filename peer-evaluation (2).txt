Project: Outbreak Offensive
Group's repository:https://github.com/brockar1999/Outbreak-Squad



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
That you could make the game a different resolution (well i probably kind of assumed that it was possible but never really knew)
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
Coronavirus is a virus, so they made a game where you play as a white blood cell and defeat the bacteria and viruses
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
They did include a boss at the end of their game, which i have not done in my games yet.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Their Future plans cover all of it; its a great game and could become a better game with more leevls added
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Not really

Is it clear that every group member participated?
After Looking at the readme, yes.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Tell the player not to go fullscreen with it; I did at first and was confused and thought it was a bug, but then realised the game is suppposed tobe played in windowed mode
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
Really good game; my group didnt even manage to fully finish its first level
